# ✍ Handwritten Digit Recognition using SVM

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The model is trained on the classic Digits Dataset available from sklearn.datasets, and developed in Google Colab.
